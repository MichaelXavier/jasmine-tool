# Jasmine Commandline Tool
I've been working with jasmine a bit for client side BDD. I like it but didn't like the gem too much so I decided to give a try at rolling my own tool written for node.js. Will publish to npm soon.

## Installation instructions
  * clone this repo
  * from the repo dir, type "npm install ."
  * type 'jasmine', should be self explainatory

have fun!
